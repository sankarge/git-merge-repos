Many thanks to @robinst for sharing this, I had great fun!!

A customized version of https://github.com/robinst/git-merge-repos

Too much customized for project needs, so doesn't make sense to merge/pull-request

Customizations
--------------

1. Preserving Tag's parent commit info
    a. We use a practice that tags are incremented by +1, ie: x-1, x-2, x-3
    b. After the merge we wanted to preserved the same, especialy in gitk view, for easire future merge.

2. Script to bootstrap many functionalities
